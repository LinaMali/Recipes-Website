        <b> <h3>Ingredients</h3></b>
        <ul type="disc">
           <li>3 cups whole-wheat flour</li>
           <li>1 cup water, approximately</li>
          <li>2 cups masala kheema</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons ghee, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <b><h3>Instruction</h3></b>
        <p><b>Step 1 <br></b>Gather the ingredients.
           <br> <b>Step 2<br></b>Place flour in a clean surface.
            <br> <b>Step 3<br></b>Adding just a little water at a time,
             knead the whole-wheat flour into a smooth, medium-soft dough. 
             It is likely that you will not need the full cup of water.
            <br> <b>Step 4<br></b>Place the dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap
             or a clean towel, and set aside for 1 hour.
            <br> <b>Step 5<br></b>In the meantime, prepare the masala kheema
             according to the recipe or allow your leftovers to reach room temperature.
            <br> <b>Step 6<br></b>Divide the dough into equally sized balls, about the size of a golf ball.
            <br> <b>Step 7<br></b>Lightly flour a clean surface and roll each ball out into a circle that is about 3 inches in diameter.
            <br> <b>Step 8<br></b>Place approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons of the masala kheema in the center of the 
            dough and fold the edges over to cover the filling completely. Gently press to seal.
             <br> <b>Step 9<br></b>Roll the dough out into a circle of 7 to 8 inches in diameter. For convenience sake,
             roll out as many parathas as you like. Stack them with a layer of cling film between 
             each paratha so they're ready to cook.
